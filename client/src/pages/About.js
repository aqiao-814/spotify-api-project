        About Us
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Hi! We are Andy Qiao, Litao Li, Michelle Shin, and Stephanie Hsing. We
        made Coverify as sophomores at the University of Illinois
        Urbana-Champaign for a class project. In a world increasingly shaped by
        artificial intelligence, we decided to incorporate AI into our project,
        and DALLÂ·E caught our attention.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        The Coverify project is a user-friendly Spotify playlist cover generator
        designed to enhance the playlist customization experience. Users can
        generate unique cover images based on playlist data. Coverify is a
        result of our dedication and collaborative efforts, and we hope you
        enjoy exploring the intersection of creativity and technology through
        our platform.
